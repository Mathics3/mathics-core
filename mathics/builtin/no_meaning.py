Operators without Built-in Meanings

Not all operators recognized by the Mathics3 are associated with functions that have built‚Äêin meanings.
You can use these operators as a way to build up your own notation within Mathics3.
"""

# WARNING: This module uses fancy MetaProgramming to create the Mathics3 Builtin classes for the
# operators in that have no pre-defined meaning. This is tricky and probably fragile code.
# We use the type() function to create the class, and setattr, to include this class inside
# this module.
