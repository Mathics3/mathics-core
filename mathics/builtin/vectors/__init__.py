In computer science, it is an array datas structure consiting of collection of elements identified by at least on array index or key.

In Mathics vectors as are Lists.  one never needs to distinguish between row and column vectors. As with other objects vectors can mix number and symbolic elements.

Vectors can be long, dense, or sparse.

Here are the grouping we have for Vector Operations:
