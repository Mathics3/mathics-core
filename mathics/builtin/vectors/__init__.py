Operations on Vectors

In mathematics and physics, a vector is a term that refers colloquially to \
some quantities that cannot be expressed by a single number. It is also a \
row or column of a matrix.

In computer science, it is an array data structure consisting of collection \
of elements identified by at least on array index or key.

In \Mathics vectors as are Lists. One never needs to distinguish between row \
and column vectors. As with other objects vectors can mix number and symbolic elements.

Vectors can be long, dense, or sparse.

Here are the grouping we have for Vector Operations:
