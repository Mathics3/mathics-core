  <li>Compute the points of the space using a function. This is done using functions like <url>:'Plot': /doc/reference-of-built-in-symbols/graphics-drawing-and-images/plotting-data/plot</url> and <url>:'ListPlot': /doc/reference-of-built-in-symbols/graphics-drawing-and-images/plotting-data/listplot</url>.
