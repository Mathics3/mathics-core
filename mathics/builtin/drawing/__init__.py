Graphics and Drawing

Showing something visually can be done in a number of ways:

<ul>
  <li>Starting with complete images and modifying them using the 'Image' Built-in function.
  <li>Use pre-defined 2D or 3D objects like <url>
  :'Circle':
  /doc/reference-of-built-in-symbols/drawing-graphics/circle</url> and <url>
  :'Cuboid':
  /doc/reference-of-built-in-symbols/graphics-drawing-and-images/three-dimensional-graphics/cuboid/</url> \
  and place them in a coordinate space.
  <li>Compute the points of the space using a function. This is done using functions like <url>
  :'Plot':
  /doc/reference-of-built-in-symbols/graphics-drawing-and-images/plotting-data/plot</url> \
  and <url>
  :'ListPlot':
  /doc/reference-of-built-in-symbols/graphics-drawing-and-images/plotting-data/listplot</url>.
</ul>
