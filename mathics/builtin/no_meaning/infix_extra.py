Infix Operators that require Additional Mathics3 Modules

Some Infix operators require loading Mathics3 Modules before the operators is used in a special way.

Right now, this happens for directed and undirected edges of a network graph. Before issuing 'LoadModule["pymathics.graph"]', \
the operators here have no meaning and can be user defined like other operators that have no pre-set meaning.
