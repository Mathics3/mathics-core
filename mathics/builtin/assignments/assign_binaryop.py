"""
Assignmment plus binary operator

There are a number operators and functions that combine assignment with some sort of binary operator.

Sometimes a value is returned <i>before</i> the assignment occurs. When there is an operator for this, the operator is a prefix operator and the function name starts with 'Pre'.

Sometimes the binary operation occurs first, and <i>then</i> the assignment occurs. When there is an operator for this, the operator is a postfix operator.

Infix operators combined with assignment end in 'By', 'From', or 'To'.
