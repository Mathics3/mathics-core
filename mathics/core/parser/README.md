# Notes on the Mathics parser

## Introduction

The Mathics- parser is an operator-precedence parser that implements the precedence climbing method. The code is written as a top-down or
recursive-descent parser.

The AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) produced after parsing is a kind of [M-expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-expression) is then
used in evaluation.

The Wolfram language is complex and has quite a few subtleties; this document attempts to cover the major ones. The language is documented
on [the Wolfram website](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/OperatorInputForms.html) although there are a few errors.

One primary feature of the Wolfram language is a large number of operators with operator precedences. This characteristic makes operator precedence parsing well suited to the language. There are however a few special language features that cannot be parsed by the standard precedence climbing algorithm.

## Precedence Climbing

Here are two references that explain the algorithm:
- [Wikipedia: Operator-precedence parser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator-precedence_parser#Precedence_climbing_method)
- [Eli Bendersky's blog entry: Parsing expressions by precedence climbing](http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2012/08/02/parsing-expressions-by-precedence-climbing)

This algorithm has a natural application to the Wolfram language.

### Precedence Value

Every operator has a numeric precedence value which. This is user-visible via the built-in function `Precedence[]`.  For example. `Precedence[Plus]` is 310.  (This function is not documented though in the WMA docs). A higher value causes an operator to bind more tightly. For example, the Times precedence, 400, is higher than the Plus precedence 310 because a + b * c is a + (b * c), not
(a + b) * c.


### Associativity

In addition to precedences, operators in the Wolfram language have a associativity or grouping attribute. Consider parsing `a || b || c`. There is some ambiguity in what order the operations should be applied. Should we use left associativity `Or[Or[a, b], c]` or right associativity `Or[a, Or[b, c]]`?

#### Flat associativity

There is an additional kind of associativity that treats _n_ repeated uses of a binary operator as that single operator applied to _n_ arguments. For example, `Plus[a, [Plus[b, c]]` is the same thing as `Plus[a, b, c]` (or `Plus[Plus[a, b], c]`). In the Wolfram language this is referred to as ['Flat'](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Flat.html) associativity. The expression tree for such a sequence flattened to the operator and its _n_ operands.

Flat associativity is not an issue in parsing, since the flat operators can be first treated as left or right associative, whichever is more efficient, and flattened once the AST is constructed.

One thing to be aware of is that parenthesis prevent the flattening of expressions at parse time, `a * (b * c)` parses as `Times[a, Times[b, c]]` but is flattened immediately afterwards.

#### Non-associativity
In addition to left/right associativity, some operators are non-associative. That is, an operator `?` is non-associative if `a ? b ? c` is not valid syntax.

A non-associative operator in the Wolfram language is
[`PatternTest`](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/PatternTest.html?q=PatternTest).

#### Implementation of binary operators

The relevant code snippet for binary operators is:


```python
def parse_binary(self, expr1, token, expr1_precedence: int) -> Node:
    """
    Implements grammar rule:
	   expr : expr1 BINARY expr2
	when it is applicable.

	When called, we have parsed expr1 and seen token BINARY. This routine will
	may cause expr2 to get scanned and parsed if applicable based on expr1_precedence.

	"expr1_precendence" is the precedence of expr1 and is used whether parsing
	should be interpreted as:
	   (expr1) BINARY expr2

	or:
	   (expr1 BINARY expr2)


    In the former case, we will return None (no further tokens
    added) and let a higher level of parsing parse:
	  (expr1) BINARY expr2.

	In the latter case, we will return a node for: (expr1 BINARY expr2).
	"""

    tag = token.tag                         # name of BINARY token

    operator_precedence = binary_ops[tag]   # lookup precedence of operator
    if operator_precedence < top_precedence:
        return None

    self.consume()                          # consume BINARY token

    if tag not in right_binary_ops:         # left/right grouping
        operator_precedence += 1

    expr2 = self.parse_exp(operator_precedence)  # parse expr2

                                            # handle nonassoc operators
    if tag in nonassoc_binary_ops and expr1.get_head_name() == tag and not expr1.parenthesised:
        self.tokeniser.sntx_message(token.pos)
        raise InvalidSyntaxError()

    result = Node(tag, expr1, expr2)        # construct the result: `BINARY[expr1, expr2]`

    if tag in flat_binary_operators:        # flatten the tree if required
        result.flatten()

    return result
```

#### Special case: Implicit times
In the Wolfram language the expression `a b` should parse as `Times[a b]`. This seemingly simple rule actually creates lots of headaches.

In the context of precedence climbing we use the rule `E_n : E_n E_n` where `n = 400` is the precedence of `Times`.

### Unary operators

The Wolfram language has two types of unary operators, prefix and postfix. As the names suggest, prefix operators come before the expression, e.g. `- 2` and postfix operators come after e.g. `10 !`.

#### Special case: unary minus
Consider the code `- - a`.  One might expect that this parses as `Minus[Minus[a]]` but in fact the unary minus is handled at parse time as `-x` becomes `Times[-1, x]`. One might expect that the answer is `Times[-1, Times[-1, a]]` but in fact this `Times` is flattened at parse time and the answer is `Times[-1, -1, a]`. We can recover the expected answer by imposing parenthesis to prevent flattening, that is `-(-a)`.

#### Special case: unary plus
Unary plus on the other hand is ignored. `+a` is the same syntactically as `a`.

### Ternary operators

The last type of standard operator in the Wolfram language are ternary operators. There are two ternary operators, `Infix` and `Span` and both are special cases. In general, they are treated like binary operators.

#### Special case: Infix

The simplest ternary operator in the Wolfram language is `Infix`, for example, `a ~ b ~ c` becomes `b[a, c]`. We treat this like a binary operator but override the rule to consume an extra `~ E`. The relevant annotated code snippet is:


```python
def e_Infix(self, expr1, token: Token, expr1_precedence: int) -> Optional[Node]:
    """
	Implements the rule:
	   expr : expr1 '~' expr2 '~' expr3
	when applicable.

	When called, we have parsed expr1 and seen token "~". This routine will
	may cause expr2 ~ expr3 to get scanned and parsed if applicable based on expr1_precedence.

	"expr1_precendence" is the precedence of expr1 and is used whether parsing
	should be interpreted as:
	   (expr1) ~ expr2 ~ expr3

	or:
	   (expr1 ~ expr2) ~ expr3

	"""
    operator_precedence = ternary_operators['Infix']   # lookup precedence of Infix
    if expr1_precedence > operator_precedence:
        return None
    self.consume()                                        # consume first '~'
    expr2 = self.parse_exp(operator_precedence + 1)       # consume expr2
    self.expect('Infix')                                  # consume second '~'
    expr3 = self.parse_exp(operator_precedence + 1)       # consume expr3
    return Node(expr2, expr1, expr3)    # return expr2[expr1, expr3]
```

#### Special case: Span

See the section on backtracking.

### Special case: Integrate

The `Integrate` rule is `E : Integrate expr1 DifferentialD expr2`. Similarly this can be handled by treating `Integrate` as a prefix operator that consumes
an extra token and expression. Unlike `Infix`, the precedences for the inner (`expr1`) and outer (`expr2`) expressions differ.

To quote the Wolfram docs:

> Forms such as `'Integral' expr1 'DifferentialD' expr2` have an "outer"
precedence just below `Power`, as indicated in the table above, but an
"inner" precedence just above `Sum`. The outer precedence determines when
`expr2` needs to be parenthesized; the inner precedence determines when
`expr1` needs to be parenthesized.

This is simple to handle with precedence climbing:

```python
def p_Integral(self, token):
    `expr : Integral expr1 DifferentialD expr2
    self.consume()                          # consume 'Integral'

    inner_prec = all_operators['Sum'] + 1   # lookup inner
    outer_prec = all_operators['Power'] - 1 # and outer prec

    expr1 = self.parse_exp(inner_prec)      # consume expr1
    self.expect('DifferentialD')            # consume 'DifferentialD'
    expr2 = self.parse_exp(outer_prec)      # consume expr2
    return Node('Integrate', expr1, expr2)
```

## Mathics3 implementation

### Precedence Climbing
All the Mathics operators are specified in `mathics/core/parser/operators.py`. The precedence climbing algorithm is implemented in
`mathics/core/parser/parser.py`. All the special cases are implemented as additional rules.

#### P Rules

Methods beginning with `p_TAG` declare what to do when the `TAG` token is
encountered at the beginning of an expression. For example, the first token
after an open parenthesis. These rules define all the atomics `E : A`, prefix
operators, `E : PREFIX E` and also brackets `E : ( E )`.

#### E Rules

Methods beginning with `e_TAG` are called when one expression is already
present and we encounter the `TAG` token. This covers binary operators
`E : E BINARY E`, postfix operators `E : E POSTFIX`, ternary operators,
`E : E TERNARY1 E TERNARY2 E`, and functions `E : E [ SEQUENCE ]`.

#### B Rules

Methods beginning with `b_TAG` are used for parsing boxes and can be ignored
on first reading of the parser code.

#### Backtracking
Most of the Wolfram language can be parsed with precedence climbing but there are a few special language features that require something more. The `Span` operator is one example.

Both `a ;; b` and `a ;;` are valid syntax, the former is the infix form of `Span` while the latter is the postfix form of `Span`, equivalent to `a ;; All`.

Now consider this example: `a;;!b`.

Here are some ways to parse this:
1. `Span[a, Not[b]]`
2. `Times[Span[a, All], Not[b]]`
3. `Times[Factorial[Span[a, All]], b]`

`x!b` parses as `Times[Factorial[x], b]` which might suggest option 3 is correct substituting `a;;` for `x`; However, the precedence of `Span` in `a;;`, 305 is lower than that of `Times`, 400. So here we must use the postfix form of `Span` and option 2 turns out to be correct.

Note: Currently, Mathics3 has a bug and parses as 1. although the correct result is 2.

The problem with `Span`, and also `CompoundExpression` is that they require arbitrary lookahead to see if the right hand side has lower precedence. It's not a large issue for `CompoundExpression` which has very low precedence but nevertheless this language quirk requires backtracking in the parser.

## Recursive Descent parsing in Python

Python does not detect tail recursion optimization. This can limit the maximum nesting level of an expression handled by a recursive descent parsers in Python. It's possible to write recursive descent parsers in an iterative style using Nicklaus Wirth's [Syntax diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_diagram). The loopings in such diagrams become `while` loops in code. You will see some while loops in the code.

Python can handle 1000 recursions, so it cal handle normal expressions seen, and can handle most parse trees. Try parsing `1 + 2 + ... 1000`!
