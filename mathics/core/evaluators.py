# comment mmatera: Other methods that I would like to have here, as non-member methods are
# ``numerify``, ``evaluation``, ``_rewrite_apply_eval_step``, ``format`` and ``boxes_to_*`` that in the current implementation
# requires to introduce local imports.
# This also would make easier to test and profile classes that store Expression-like objects and methods that produce the evaluation.
