## Description

<!-- Please add a clear and concise description of the bug. Try to reduce the bug to the minimum expression that exhibits the bug.
     For example, if an an expression occurs with several terms, can these be removed and the bug still appears? If so
	 we would like the reduced, simpler expression.

	 If the expression can be written in SymPy, does SymPy also exhibit the problem?
