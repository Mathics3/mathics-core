<!-- Feel free to remove sections marked optional if they are not relevant. The other sections, please fill out. See also https://github.com/Mathics3/mathics-core/blob/master/REPORTING-BUGS.md -->

## Description

<!-- Please add a clear and concise description of the bug. Try to reduce the bug to the minimum   expression that exhibits the bug.
     For example, if an expression occurs with several terms, can these be removed and the bug still appear? If so, we would like the reduced, simpler expression.

      If the expression can be written in SymPy, does SymPy also exhibit the problem?
-->

## How to Reproduce

<!--
Steps to reproduce the behavior.

For Django:
1. Go to ...
2. Enter ....
2. Click on ....
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error

For a command-line environment:

$mathics -c 'E ^ (Pi I)'  # adjust expression E ^ (Pi I) for the specific bug

-->

## Output Given

<!--
Please include not just the error message but all output leading to the message, which includes echoing input and messages up to the error.
For a command-line environment, include the command invocation and all the output produced.

If this is too long, then try narrowing the problem to something short.

## Expected behavior

<!-- Add a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->

## Your Environment

<!--

Sometimes problems are specific to a particular environment or
software release. If you have access to several environments, it is helpful to check whether this fails on more than one environment.  Please
indicate that when available.

If you are using a recently released Python package that Mathics3
uses, it is possible we haven't tested this, and the new package is not
compatible. Try on an older software release, and if that is still the problem, let us
know about the breakage in the version.

In either case, please include the output from:

  mathics --version

This information is also posted when you enter either the `mathics` or `mathicsscript` commands.

If you are running from a browser Django, please note the browser type, e.g., Firefox, Chrome, Safari.

Inside Django, http://localhost/about provides information, which you can cut and paste here.

## Workarounds

<!-- If there is a workaround for the problem, describe that here. -->

## Priority

<!-- If this is blocking some important activity, let us know what activity it blocks. -->

## Additional context

<!--
This is optional. Please add any other context about the problem here or special environment setup.
